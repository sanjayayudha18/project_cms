| # | Product | Role |
| ---| ---| --- |
| 1 | Compute Engine | Frontend (internal + vendor) |
| 2 | Compute Engine | Backend, currently ONE VM running both `backend/` (ATM, port 8080) and `backend-cit/` (CIT, port 8081) as separate containers — see split-VM plan below |
| 3 | CloudSQL Postgres | Primary (write) |
| 4 | CloudSQL Postgres | Read replica (reporting/dashboard) |
| 5 | Cloud Storage | Uploads/exports/escrow batch files |
| 6 | Memorystore Redis | Cache/sessions |
| 7 | Artifact Registry | Docker images |
| 8 | Cloud Build | CI: build -> test -> scan -> push |
| 9 | Secret Manager | Secrets (JWT, LDAP, SMTP, DB) |
| 10 | Cloud DNS | Domains (internal + vendor) |
| 11 | Cloud Armor | WAF (esp. vendor portal) |
| 12 | Cloud Logging | Structured logs |
| 13 | Cloud Monitoring | Metrics/alerts (incl. replica lag) |

**Current state (now): ONE Compute Engine VM runs both backends** as separate Docker containers (`backend` on 8080, `backend-cit` on 8081) — see root `docker-compose.yml` (Sec 9). Fine for now: CIT is still a skeleton with no real endpoints, low load.

**Planned (2028): split into two separate Compute Engine VMs**, one per backend. This is *why* the codebase was split into a Go workspace with a shared `pkg/` module (Sec 3) well ahead of the actual VM split: each backend already has its own `go.mod`/Dockerfile/image and zero import-time dependency on the other, so moving CIT to its own VM later requires **no code change** — just deploy the existing `cms-backend-cit` image to a new VM and repoint its `.env`. When that split happens:
*   Both VMs must reach the **same** CloudSQL primary/replica (#3/#4) and the **same** Memorystore Redis (#6) — Redis is shared for JWT blacklist + rate-limit counters (`pkg/auth`, `pkg/middleware`), so a second Redis instance would desync those.
*   `JWT_SECRET` must be identical on both VMs via Secret Manager (#9) — CIT only *validates* tokens (`pkg/auth.TokenService`), it never issues them; ATM is the sole issuer.
*   Firewall/VPC rules must allow the CIT VM the same egress to CloudSQL + Memorystore as the ATM VM.

**Pipeline**: Cloud Build -> lint + go test + vite build (x2) -> build images (`backend/Dockerfile`, `backend-cit/Dockerfile`, separately) -> push to Artifact Registry with immutable tag (git SHA, not latest) -> deploy to Compute Engine (one VM today, one VM per backend from 2028).
**Rollback**: keep previous image SHA deployable, per service.
